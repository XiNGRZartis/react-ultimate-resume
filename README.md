# Developer-Profile by WeLoveDevs.com
**Developer-Profile** is an open-source customizable software developer resume to highlight your skills and experiences.

Discover a modern approach of the traditionnal CV that includes animations and latest front-end technologies. Impress recruiters or customers with your projects, hobbies and experiences as never before. 

We used [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume), a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. 
Discover the official schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).  
We added a few extra-fields to JSON Resume standard to fit developers needs. Learn more about them [here](#json-resume-extra-fields).

This app is built using the popular [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You will find a lot of resources to understand how to edit and publish your resume directly on https://create-react-app.dev/
