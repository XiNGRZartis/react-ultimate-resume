# Standalone Deploying your Resume Template

Deploying this component on your own server is a very valid option üòÅ

## First Fork Us !

Use the fork button on [the main project](https://github.com/welovedevs/react-ultimate-resume)

You get your very own fork of the [project like mine](https://github.com/thedamfr/react-ultimate-resume).

[![My Fork Preview](http://cdn.filestackcontent.com/compress/zyZVEY7oQpiWtG8TpNVH)](https://github.com/thedamfr/react-ultimate-resume)

`git clone` this fork

Enter the repository and run `yarn install` and open it your favorite code editor.

## Add your JSONResume

JSONResume is an open scheme for resume. We added a few extra fields, refer to the main documentation to learn more.

Export your JSONResume from WeLoveDevs.com or any website supporting the schema.

I highly recommend working on a separate branch with you own data.

`git checkout -b my_new_branch`

We provide the JsonResume to the component in `App.jsx`. Feel free to edit the `src/data/json_stub.json` or to provide your own component via an API or such. 

Test it out :

```
yarn start
```

And visit http://localhost:3000
